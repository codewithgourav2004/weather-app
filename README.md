- **Current Weather Conditions**: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and visibility for your location.
- **Forecasts**: Hourly, daily, and weekly predictions to help users plan their activities.
- **Severe Weather Alerts**: Notifies users about storms, heavy rainfall, extreme heat, or other potentially hazardous weather conditions.
- **Interactive Radar Maps**: Visualizes precipitation, temperature patterns, and cloud movements in a specific region.
- **Personalization**: Allows users to save multiple locations, customize notifications, and choose temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
- **Additional Features**: Includes information about UV index, sunrise/sunset times, air quality, and sometimes even pollen levels.

 

Do you have a specific weather app in mind you'd like me to elaborate on?
